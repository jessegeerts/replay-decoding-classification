Modus, with names beginning with "custom_", are each allied to a standard python language feature, or package. 
The idea is that they offer features that are (or could be) general enough that they are more closely related to their 
namesake language feature/package than to any particular kind of analysis.

Other utilities that don't fit into this category have names beginning with "utils_".

Note that just because a function can be found here does not mean that it has a valid reason for existing - some things may be stupid/broken or easily achived using comonnly available packages/lagnuage features etc.
Indeed many of the functions contained in these modules are no longer used anywhere in the codebase.
