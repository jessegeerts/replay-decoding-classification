# Replay decoding / classification

Code to run the state space models from the `replay_trajectory_classification' package on Axona type data.

Run decode_ztrack_data.py to run decoding. 
Run classify_ztrack_data.py to try replay classification.

## Requirements
I've added a conda environment file to the repository: analysis_env.yml. This should be sufficient to run the code.
